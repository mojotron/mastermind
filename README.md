## How to play

Three game modes easy(code length: 3, possible colors: 4), normal(code length: 4, possible colors: 6), and hard(code length: 5, possible colors: 8).

## What have I learned

- NPM
- Webpack bundler - basic configuration, loading css.
- ES6 Modules
- ES6 Classes
- Model-View-Controller pattern
- Publisher-Subscriber pattern
- Config file
- Helpers file

Using config file for game data that is used in multiple places through out project, later if we want to change something we change variable in one place.
